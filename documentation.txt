ROJECT OVERVIEW: "GHIH Smart Port Analytics Demo"
What You'll Build:
A complete ML portfolio project simulating Djibouti's port operations with 4 components

🎬 FICTIONAL SCENARIO
Setting: Doraleh Multipurpose Port, Djibouti (Jan 2023 - Dec 2024)
Data: 2 years of fictional but realistic port operations
Goal: Show GHIH how ML can optimize their operations

📁 THE 4 COMPONENTS
1. Traffic Forecasting (Time Series)
Fictional Dataset:

730 days of daily container arrivals (2023-2024)
Columns: date, containers_arrived, day_of_week, month, season, holidays
Realistic patterns:

Weekly cycle (lower on weekends)
Seasonal peaks (higher in Nov-Dec before holidays)
Random variations
Some COVID-recovery growth trend



Sample Data:
Date         | Containers | Day      | Holiday
-------------|------------|----------|--------
2023-01-01   | 245        | Sunday   | Yes
2023-01-02   | 412        | Monday   | No
2023-01-03   | 438        | Tuesday  | No
...
What You'll Predict:

Next 30 days of container volume
Compare 3 models: ARIMA vs Prophet vs XGBoost
Show accuracy metrics (RMSE, MAE)
Beautiful forecast charts

Impact Statement:

"With 85% accuracy, GHIH can predict container volume 30 days ahead, enabling optimal crane and staff allocation."


2. Dwell Time Prediction (Regression)
Fictional Dataset:

5,000 containers from 2024
Columns: container_id, origin_country, cargo_type, customs_status, arrival_date, truck_availability, actual_dwell_time_hours
Realistic scenarios:

Ethiopian cargo: 48-72 hours (fast, DIFTZ)
Saudi Arabia cargo: 96-120 hours (inspection needed)
Perishable goods: 24-36 hours (priority)
General cargo: 72-96 hours



Sample Data:
Container  | Origin    | Type        | Customs | Dwell Time
-----------|-----------|-------------|---------|------------
CNT001234  | Ethiopia  | Electronics | Fast    | 52 hours
CNT001235  | China     | Textiles    | Normal  | 89 hours
CNT001236  | UAE       | Food        | Fast    | 28 hours
...
What You'll Predict:

How long each container will stay at port
Random Forest model (best performer)
Feature importance: Which factors matter most?
Classification: Will it stay >72h? (Yes/No)

Impact Statement:

"Predicting dwell time with 82% accuracy helps GHIH optimize storage space and reduce congestion."


3. Route Optimization (Optimization + ML)
Fictional Dataset:

6 locations in Djibouti:

Doraleh Port
DIFTZ (Free Trade Zone)
Damerjog Port
Djibouti City Center
Ethiopia Border (Galafi)
Airport


50 daily truck routes
Columns: truck_id, origin, destination, cargo_weight, distance_km, traffic_level, fuel_cost, time_taken_minutes

Sample Data:
Truck   | From      | To        | Distance | Traffic | Time   | Cost
--------|-----------|-----------|----------|---------|--------|------
TRK001  | Doraleh   | DIFTZ     | 15 km    | Medium  | 35 min | $12
TRK002  | DIFTZ     | Ethiopia  | 85 km    | Low     | 95 min | $45
TRK003  | Damerjog  | City      | 22 km    | High    | 55 min | $18
...
What You'll Build:

Optimal route recommendations using ML clustering
Cost optimization (save fuel by 15%)
Time optimization (reduce delivery time by 20%)
Visual map showing optimized vs current routes

Impact Statement:

"ML-optimized routing saves GHIH $500K annually in fuel costs and reduces delivery time by 18%."


4. Anomaly Detection (Unsupervised ML)
Fictional Dataset:

Same 5,000 containers from component #2
Add suspicious patterns:

50 containers with unusually long dwell times (fraud?)
30 containers with weird customs patterns
20 containers with unusual truck assignments



Anomalies to Detect:
Normal Container:
- Origin: Ethiopia → Dwell: 48h → Customs: Fast → Cost: $200

🚨 ANOMALY 1: Suspiciously Fast
- Origin: Saudi Arabia → Dwell: 12h → Customs: Fast → Cost: $200
  (Saudi cargo usually takes 4 days, not 12 hours!)

🚨 ANOMALY 2: Unexplained Delay  
- Origin: Ethiopia → Dwell: 240h (10 days!) → Customs: Fast → Cost: $200
  (Why is Ethiopian cargo sitting for 10 days with fast customs?)

🚨 ANOMALY 3: Cost Mismatch
- Origin: China → Dwell: 72h → Customs: Normal → Cost: $5
  (Cost way too low, possible fraud)
What You'll Detect:

Isolation Forest finds top 50 suspicious containers
Visual scatter plots showing normal vs anomalies
Risk scoring system (0-100)
Alert system for operations team

Impact Statement:

"Anomaly detection flags 3-5% of suspicious containers daily, preventing fraud and reducing delays."
